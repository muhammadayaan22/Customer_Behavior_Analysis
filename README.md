# 📊 Data Analytics Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end Data Analytics workflow, starting from raw data to actionable business insights.  
The dataset is processed and analyzed using Python (Jupyter Notebook), stored and queried in PostgreSQL using SQL, and visualized through an interactive Power BI dashboard. Final insights are summarized in a report and presentation.

This project highlights practical skills in data cleaning, analysis, database querying, and data storytelling.
